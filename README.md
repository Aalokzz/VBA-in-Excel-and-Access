# VBA-in-Excel-and-Access
Final project I created for my INF 110 course where I had to create a application in Excel which calculates a final price of pizza after selecting options of topping and a pizza slice, allows vendor to change price and can be modified to even print receipt


Warning!!-----The program uses macros!!
